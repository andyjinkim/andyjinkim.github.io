## *Description of Othello*

Othello is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical, circular game pieces that are either white or black. Players take turns placing these pieces on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any pieces of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the piece just placed and another piece of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

The object of the game is to have the majority of pieces turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.

Once a winner is announced, you have the option of clearing the game board and playing again.

This is a two-player game. Computer AI play is unavailable at this time.
